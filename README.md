*   *Introduction to Fusion Page in DaVinci Resolve*

The Fusion page in DaVinci Resolve is a powerful visual effects and motion graphics workspace that uses a node-based system. Each node in Fusion performs a specific function, such as adding effects, transforming objects, or adjusting image quality. Nodes are connected in a flow to create complex effects and composites.

*   *Key Types of Nodes in Fusion:*

1.  *Media Nodes*: Handles media input (Media In) and output (Media Out).
2.  *Transform Nodes*: Allows manipulation of elements, such as scaling, rotation, and position changes.
3.  *Effect Nodes*: Includes various effects, like colour grading, blurs, and image adjustments.
    *   *Correction Nodes:* Used for colour correction and grading.
    *   *Compound Nodes:* Combine multiple nodes into one for easier management.
4.  *Tracking Nodes*: Used for tracking motion within a scene; the Planar Tracker node is commonly used for tracking camera movement or stabilizing shots.

*   *My Work*

1.  Add the clip you want to edit.
2.  Align it according to the timeline like where ever the beat hits.
3.  Use marker for a bit precious location of the beats.
4.  Add a fusion composition from the effect tab and align it to the frame length needed.
5.  I used a [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/S4yUsaM3x7A?si=xDUzOy3aJsrIoXm9) and followed the procedure to make a 3D text animation.

*   *Colour Grading*

Colour Grading is a post-production process in video editing to alter the appearance of an image or video to attain a certain aesthetic or convey a certain emotion.

The word most often used CC which refer to colour correction is a common term used for enhancing the colour of the clip and giving it a better feel.

*DaVinci Resolve's Colour grading features:*

*   *Colour Wheel:* A tool that allows for primary colour adjustments using a circular interface to manipulate hue, saturation, and luminance. Lift is the base tones, gamma being mid tones and gain is the high tones. Offset increases/decreases the overall colour tone in the entire clip.

*   *Colour Wrapper*: In DaVinci Resolve 19, the Colour Warper is a powerful tool for advanced colour grading, allowing precise adjustments to hue and saturation. It presents a 2D grid where you can manipulate colours by dragging control points, enabling complex colour transformations with ease. This feature is particularly useful for tasks like skin tone adjustments, colour matching between shots, and creating stylized looks. The Colour Warper enhances creative flexibility, making it an essential tool for achieving professional-grade colour correction and grading.

*My task:*

*To make a cutout transition*

*   Freeze the clip you are using
*   Go to colour page
*   Window  ![alt text](l21.jpg)
*   Then chose the 4th option from the beginning.

*   Then carefully select the parts you want to cut.
*   In the node window press right click and choose add alpha output and connect the alpha output to the clip.
